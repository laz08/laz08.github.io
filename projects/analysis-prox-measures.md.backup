## About

This thesis is a research project about studying multiple (20) different proximity indices between nodes in a given network or graph. 


Due to a confidentiality agreement with both my supervisors and some plans in the near future that involve this whole study, I am not publishing my thesis yet neither the code.


But feel free to ask me about it :)

## Code

The code (which, again, is not published yet) has been written in R with around 3k to 4k lines of code. Includes a Shiny App in R.
