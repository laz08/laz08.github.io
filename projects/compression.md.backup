Several small projects were done to study data compression.

All their implementations have been done in **Python**.

They were assignments for the subject called *Data and Images Compression* (CDI) for Facultat d'Informatica de Barcelona at Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (FIB - UPC). This subject is from the Degree in Computer Science at said university.
