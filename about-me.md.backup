## Hi! I'm Laura C.

I was born on the 3rd of August in '94.

To summarize, we could say I am a...

- Data Science / Analyst student.
- Computer Science Bachelor / Software Engineer.
- Occasional nature hiker.
- (Very) amateur photographer.

Oh, and I **love** using bullet lists to organize everything.

### Interests

Currently, my main interests revolve around **Data Science** and **Machine learning**. 

### Education

I graduated on Computer Science at Facultat d'Informatica de Barcelona, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (FIB, UPC) and specialized at Software Engineering.
	
Because of the interests mentioned above, I am **currently studying** a 2-year master degree program about Data Science, named Master in Innovation and Research in Informatics.

I have already done the first year, so only the second one is left.

### Former job

I am a former **Android developer**, job that I took during almost 2 years, starting doing an internship for a local company.

Having worked there I gained experience on how to work in big projects and learned about teamwork, which I find most important.

Although I always loved my work there, for that line of work makes you be in touch with different disciplines like databases, accessing external APIs and such, I found that I wanted to broaden my horizons. And data is a whole world to explore as long as there is data to be taken.

Which is why I went back to study :)

### Others

- I'm from Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.
- I speak three languages:
	+ Catalan (mother tongue)
	+ Spanish (mother tongue too)
	+ English (Cambridge English: Advanced (CAE), C1. Grade: B)
