## Hi! I'm Laura C.

I was born on the 3rd of August in '94.

To summarize, we could say I am a...

- Data Sciencist / Analyst.
- Computer Science Bachelor / Software Engineer.
- Occasional nature hiker.


Oh, and I **love** using bullet lists to organize everything.

### Interests

Currently, my main interests revolve around **Data Science** and **Machine learning**. I have also taken a keen interest in graphs, in the context of Complex social networks. 

### Education
	
I have coursed a 2-year master degree program about Data Science ([Master in Innovation and Research in Informatics](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-innovation-and-research-informatics)), at  Facultat d'Informatica de Barcelona, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (FIB, UPC). Finished on July, 2019.

I graduated on Computer Science and specialized at Software Engineering at the same faculty a couple of years before.


### Former job

I am a former *Android developer*, job that I took during almost 2 years, starting as an intern for a local company.

Having worked there I gained experience on how to work in big projects and learned about teamwork, which I find most important.

Although I always loved my work there, for that line of work makes you be in touch with different disciplines like databases, accessing external APIs and such, I found that I wanted to broaden my horizons. And data is a whole world to explore as long as there is data to be taken.

Which is why I went back to study and got my master's degree.

### Others

- I'm from Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.
- I speak three languages:
	+ Catalan (native)
	+ Spanish (native)
	+ English (Cambridge English: Advanced (CAE), C1. Grade: B, in 2012)
